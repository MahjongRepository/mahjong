This library can calculate hand cost (han, fu with details, yaku, and scores) for riichi mahjong (Japanese version).

Also calculating of shanten is supported.

The code was validated on tenhou.net phoenix replays in total on **11,120,125 hands**.

So, we can say that our hand calculator works the same way that tenhou.net hand calculation.

## How to install

```bash
pip install mahjong
```
